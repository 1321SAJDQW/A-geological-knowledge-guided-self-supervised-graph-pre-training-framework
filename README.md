## A geological knowledge-guided graph self-supervised pre-training framework for recognition of geochemical anomalies related to mineralization

This code implements the geological knowledge-guided graph self-supervised pre-training (GKGP) framework by integrating geological domain knowledge into Graph Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to recognize geochemical anomalies. Baseline is used as a benchmarking module to compare model performance. The create graph module constructs graph-structured data, while the ROC module evaluates model performance.
